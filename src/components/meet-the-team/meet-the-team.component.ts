      'Hey everyone! My name is William Jiang and I&lsquo;m thrilled to be serving as PassionFruit Youth&lsquo;s Chief Executive Officer. I founded PFY with the hopes of connecting the youth of today with opportunities that will enhance their ambitions of pursuing their "passion". For far too long, many auspicious youth are forced to abandon their aspirations due to a lack of support, absence of opportunities, and most of all, the expectation to be apart of the "norm". It&lsquo;s time for change. Here at PFY, we aim to foster a community that not only supports one-another&lsquo;s ambitions, but collectively builds on each others successes, breaking boundaries and reaching new heights. Through various high-impact community events, volunteer/career insight opportunities, self-growth workshops and more, PFY has its sights on being the premier hub for cultivating prospering dreams for youth.'
